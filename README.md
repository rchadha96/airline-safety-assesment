# Airline Safety Assesment
Project Goal: To Assess Airline Safety and generate Risk Score based on track record using R  

## Introduction

The case study was done to assess the safety of airlines based on its track record, using the airline safety data hosted by FiveThirtyEight, which provides the safety records of major commercial airlines, over a span of 30 years. The context of this analysis is the outcome of certain academic studies that high-profile crashes can shift passenger demand away from the airlines involved in the disasters. 

The dataset divides the 30-year period into two halves and gives information about the number of crashes, fatal accidents and fatalities occurred over these years along with available seat kilometers (ASKs) of 56 different airlines. 

The prime objective of the case study was to check whether there was a relation between the crash rates of first time period and that of the second which would imply that the risk is persistent and is predictable based on its crash history.

## Analysis
### Data Standardization:
Based on the dataset obtained we have categorized the airline into private and government airlines.

```r
  air <- read_csv("AirlineSafety-SAS.csv")
  # Adding Type of airline.
  air <- air %>%
  mutate(type=ifelse(grepl("*", airline, fixed = TRUE),"Government","Private"))
```
### Data Visualization:
In-order to find the correlation of crash rate from one period to the next a scatterplot matrix was produced. The three variables: incident, fatal_accidents, fatalities are compared between two periods and how the distribution changes for the Government-owned and private-owned airlines.

Overall, there is no relation between fatalities from one period to another but incidents ae slightly correlated.

To gain detailed inferences about the data and the relationship among the variables, the following visualizations were produced:

The scatterplot below shows the incidents which resulted into fatal accidents for both the periods and the distribution of that between government and private owned airlines.
